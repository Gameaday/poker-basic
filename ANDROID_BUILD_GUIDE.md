# Android Build Setup for Poker Game

This directory contains the Android build infrastructure for creating APK files alongside the existing JAR builds.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Internet connection (required for Android SDK download)
- Java 17 (already configured in the main project)

### Building Android APK

1. **First-time setup** (requires internet):
   ```bash
   # From project root
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

2. **Build outputs**:
   - APK file: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - Installable on Android devices running API 28+ (Android 9.0+)

### Architecture

The Android build reuses the existing Java source code from `Poker-Basic/src/main/java/com/pokermon/` through Gradle's `sourceSets` configuration. This means:

- âœ… Same game logic for both JAR and APK
- âœ… No code duplication
- âœ… Consistent behavior across platforms

### Files Structure

```
poker-basic/
â”œâ”€â”€ Poker-Basic/           # Maven project (JAR build)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/java/com/pokermon/  # Shared Java source
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pom.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                   # Android module (APK build)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java/com/pokermon/MainActivity.java  # Android UI
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AndroidManifest.xml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ res/           # Android resources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build.gradle       # Android build config
â”œâ”€â”€ build.gradle           # Root build config
â”œâ”€â”€ settings.gradle        # Gradle settings
â””â”€â”€ gradlew               # Gradle wrapper
```

### Platform-Specific Features

#### Desktop (JAR)
- Swing GUI (`NewJFrame.java`)
- Console mode (`ConsoleMain.java`)
- Full keyboard/mouse interaction

#### Android (APK)
- Native Android UI (`MainActivity.java`)
- Touch-friendly interface
- Material Design components
- Support for phones and tablets

### Verification

Run the verification task to check dual platform setup:
```bash
./gradlew verifyDualPlatformSetup
```

This checks that both Maven and Android configurations are properly set up.

### Network Requirements

- **Maven/JAR builds**: Work offline after initial dependency download
- **Android/APK builds**: Require internet for Android SDK components

### Troubleshooting

1. **"Plugin not found" errors**: Ensure internet connection for first Android build
2. **SDK not found**: Android SDK will be automatically downloaded on first build
3. **Build fails in CI**: Expected in environments without internet access
4. **"Package conflicts with existing package"**: See `ANDROID_DEBUG_BUILDS.md` for debug build configuration

### Development Build Conflicts

If you encounter "App not installed as package conflicts with an existing package" when installing development builds, see the dedicated guide:

ðŸ“– **[ANDROID_DEBUG_BUILDS.md](ANDROID_DEBUG_BUILDS.md)** - Resolving package conflicts between debug and release builds

### Version Code System

The Android build uses a timestamp-based version code system for automatic incrementing:
- **Base Epoch**: June 25, 2025 (Unix timestamp: 1750809600)
- **Formula**: `(days_since_epoch * 100) + current_hour`
- **Details**: See [ANDROID_DEBUG_BUILDS.md](ANDROID_DEBUG_BUILDS.md) for complete documentation

The Android infrastructure is fully configured and ready for development environments with network access.
