## Cohesive Monster System Implementation Plan

### üéØ Overview
Implement a unified monster system that integrates battling, catching, training, and collecting across all game modes while maintaining clear state-based design and comprehensive save/configuration management.

### üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

#### 1. Enhanced Monster System
- **MonsterBattleSystem**: Unified battle mechanics across modes
- **MonsterTrainingSystem**: Experience, leveling, and skill development
- **MonsterBreedingSystem**: Combine monsters for new varieties
- **MonsterEvolutionSystem**: Transform monsters based on conditions

#### 2. Player Profile System
- **PlayerProfile**: Cross-game persistent data
- **MonsterInventory**: Enhanced collection management
- **GameProgress**: Track progress across all modes
- **SaveSystem**: Comprehensive save/load functionality

#### 3. Enhanced State Management
- **MonsterStates**: Battle, training, evolution states
- **CrossModeStates**: Share data between game modes
- **PersistenceStates**: Save/load operations
- **TrainingSubStates**: Detailed training interactions
