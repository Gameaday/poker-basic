Built with **pure Kotlin-native architecture** using advanced state management patterns, comprehensive AI systems, and professional code quality standards.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📦 Native Executables (Primary Deliverables)
```bash
# 🚀 TRUE NATIVE BUILDS (No Java Required) - NEW!
./gradlew :shared:buildNativeLinux --no-daemon     # Linux native executable (~514KB)
./gradlew :shared:buildNativeWindows --no-daemon   # Windows native executable (~682KB)
./gradlew :desktop:packageNativeLinux --no-daemon  # Package Linux native for distribution
./gradlew :desktop:packageNativeWindows --no-daemon # Package Windows native for distribution

# Run native executables (no Java installation needed):
./shared/build/native/linux/pokermon-linux.kexe    # Linux
./shared/build/native/windows/pokermon-windows.exe # Windows (via Wine or Windows)
./desktop/build/distributions/pokermon-linux-native # Packaged Linux native

# 📦 JPACKAGE BUILDS (Include Java Runtime) - Legacy Support  
./gradlew :desktop:packageNative --no-daemon       # Current platform (auto-detect)
./gradlew :desktop:packagewindows --no-daemon      # Windows installer with bundled Java
./gradlew :desktop:packagelinux --no-daemon        # Linux .deb with bundled Java
./gradlew :desktop:packagemacos --no-daemon        # macOS .dmg with bundled Java

# Check build capabilities:
./gradlew :shared:nativeInfo --no-daemon           # Show Kotlin/Native information
./gradlew :desktop:nativeInfoEnhanced --no-daemon # Show all build options
```

**🔥 True Native vs jpackage:**
