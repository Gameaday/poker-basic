- **pokermon_{version}_amd64.deb** (40MB) - Linux native package

### Platform Launchers (Fallback)

- **pokermon-{version}.command** - macOS launcher script

## Usage

```bash
java -jar pokermon-alpha-{version}.jar --help
java -jar pokermon-alpha-{version}.jar --basic    # Console mode
java -jar pokermon-alpha-{version}.jar             # GUI mode
```

### Linux DEB Package

sudo dpkg -i pokermon_{version}_amd64.deb
pokermon  # Run from system

## Artifact Notes

- **JAR files** work on any platform with Java 17+
- **Native packages** provide platform-specific integration
- **Launcher scripts** are fallbacks when native compilation isn't available
- **APK** requires Android 9.0+ (API 28+)

## CI/CD Integration

These artifacts are automatically:
1. Generated on every build
2. Uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts
3. Retained for 90 days (main branch) or 14 days (PR builds)
4. Available for download from the Actions tab

The large binary files (JAR, APK, DEB) are excluded from git commits but preserved in CI artifacts for distribution.
