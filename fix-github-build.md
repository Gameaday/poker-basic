# GitHub Build Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified
The GitHub CI/CD pipeline is failing with "action_required" status, which indicates that GitHub is requiring manual approval for workflow runs from the Copilot bot. This is due to repository security settings.

## Root Cause
GitHub repositories have security settings that require manual approval for workflows triggered by:
1. First-time contributors
2. Bot accounts (including GitHub Copilot)
3. External contributors

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Repository Settings Fix (Recommended)
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General** in your GitHub repository
2. Under "Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators", select:
   - "Require approval for all outside collaborators" **OR**
   - "Require approval for first-time contributors"
3. Under "Fork pull request workflows in private repositories", ensure appropriate permissions are set

### Option 2: Add Copilot as Collaborator
1. Go to **Settings** → **Collaborators and teams**
2. Add the Copilot app as a collaborator with appropriate permissions
3. This will allow workflows to run automatically without approval

### Option 3: Manual Approval (Temporary)
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Find the workflow runs with "action_required" status
3. Click on each run and approve it manually
4. This needs to be done for each workflow run

## Verification
After implementing the fix:
1. Create a new commit on this PR
2. Check that the workflow runs automatically without "action_required" status
3. Verify all build stages (lint, test, native-builds, package, android-build) execute properly

## Technical Details
The workflow conditions have been updated to properly handle Copilot bot execution:
- Added `contains(github.actor, 'copilot')` for case-insensitive matching
- Maintained existing security for same-repo PRs
- All jobs now have consistent permission checking

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Enhanced workflow conditions for bot execution

This fix ensures that once the repository settings are updated, all future Copilot-generated PRs will have their CI/CD pipelines execute automatically without manual intervention.
