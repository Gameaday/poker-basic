/**
 * Centralized version management for the Pokermon application.
 * This object serves as the single point of truth for all version information
 * across desktop JAR, Android APK, and other build targets.
 *
 * Versioning uses different approaches per platform:
 * - JAR builds: Git commit count-based versioning for reproducible desktop builds
 * - Android builds: Timestamp-based versioning for reliable APK update ordering
 *
 * This hybrid approach ensures proper version management across all build targets
 * while maintaining semantic versioning for major and minor releases.
